# MinNvim

My Neovim configuration aimed at being as minimal as possible without sacrificing functionality. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a Neovim distribution but a personal and opinionated configuration. Therefore, expect frequent changes.

- Only ~15-20 plugins installed. The aim is to use Neovim's native functionality as much as possible without relying on many third-party dependencies. Custom built-in functionality is preferred over installing a plugin.
- Native LSP management with `vim.lsp.enable`
- Native plugin management around `vim.pack.add`
- Native sessions management with `mksession`
- Minimal monochromatic colorscheme
